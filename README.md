# hake_growth

A project initiated during an internship through Sustainable Oceans NSF NRT at the NOAA NWFSC under the supervision of Dr. Kristin Marshall.

This project will focus on investigating trends trends in Pacific Hake weight-at-age and whether and how this variability will impact stock assessment methods.

Guiding questions are:
1) What are the local and regional trends in Pacific Hake weight-at-age?
2) Which covariates explain these changes and what effect do they have on Pacific Hake weight-at-age?
3) To what extent does incorporating growth variation into the interpolation of missing data within the stock assessment affect the estimation of management reference points?

This work is funded through the NMFS-Sea Grant Joint Fellowship in Population and Ecosystem Dynamics.
